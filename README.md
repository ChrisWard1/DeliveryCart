Assignment 3 - Online Grocery Membership Prototype
Description
This assignment is meant for you to exercise the skills you've developed in CIDM2315 and CIDM3312 such that you implement a quick prototype of the Online Grocery Delivery project (from previous assignments) with at least two ASP.NET 5.0 Razor views/forms which perform support the business transactions of the system with an emphasis on CRUD operations on the underlying model.  This is by no means meant to be a complete application, rather, this is meant to demonstrate to me that you have the basic skills to be productive.  I am providing you with some guidelines/constraints for the project.
Requirements
Create at least two ASP.NET 5.0 (using Razor pages form/views that utilize a local SQLite database (DB file)
These forms/views should show the function of a business transaction from the broader Online Grocery Delivery application.
Each form should facilitate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your underlying model
Each form should be from a different actor's perspective
Pairing
Select another student in the course to partner with; Perhaps that could be somebody you worked with in Assignment 2.
Install the CodeTogether extension for Visual Studio Code. 
Arrange to spend at least two hours working on this assignment project together as a Pair Programming exercise. 
Provide a report of that experience along with the code for this assignment. 
Watch this video to get a sense of what Pair Programming is meant to be: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-x-T34z9w
Also, trade places during the exercise where one of you is the "driver" and the other is the "navigator" as Lucy Bain explains in that video.
You will prepare a one-page report outlining what advantages and disadvantages you experienced during pairing.
While the requirement is to spend a minimum of the two hours, you are welcome to continue to pair for a longer duration.
Refresher Tutorials
You might find these refresher tutorials useful. Further, since ASP.NET is now at version 6.0, there may be some changes since you took CIDM3312 and CIDM4360.
Tutorial: Create a Razor Pages web app with ASP.NET Core - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio-code
Tutorial: Razor Pages with Entity Framework Core in ASP.NET Core - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-rp/intro?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio-code
Also, note that each tutorial has a tabbed set of choices depending on what editor environment you will be in.  I will ONLY demonstrate using VSCode in videos and in class.
Github
From this point forward, I will expect code submissions to be provided both as a ZIPPED archive as well as pushed to a Github repository.
Brad Traversy's "crash course" and tutorial are a good start for using Git and Github: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc
Deliverables
ZIP up code project directory
Individual Github repository of the code - the URL to your github repo.
